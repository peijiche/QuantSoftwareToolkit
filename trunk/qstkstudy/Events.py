"""
Accepts a list of symbols along with start and end date
Returns the Event Matrix which is a pandas Datamatrix
Event matrix has the following structure :
    |IBM |GOOG|XOM |MSFT| GS | JP |
(d1)|nan |nan | 1  |nan |nan | 1  |
(d2)|nan | 1  |nan |nan |nan |nan |
(d3)| 1  |nan | 1  |nan | 1  |nan |
(d4)|nan |  1 |nan | 1  |nan |nan |
...................................

Also, d1 = start date
nan = no information about any event.
1 = status bit(positively confirms the event occurence)

DataAccessTester.py is a convenient way to test the dataAcess routines.


Make sure that the path being given to the constructor is the folder which has all the hdf5 files. 

Also, make sure that the stocks whose data you ask for are actually there.

After this, just run it like a normal python program and it should work.


NOTE: The dataAcces class will raise errors if the stock you ask for isn't there or something like that
